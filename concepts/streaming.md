# General Overview

The carbon api has a websocket resource `api/stream` that exposes a real time feed of data points and events. There are three endpoints:

* `/api/stream/:id/data` - opens up one websocket that will publish all data points for the node `:id`. To unsubscribe simply close the socket.

* `/api/stream/:id/event` - opens up one websocket that will publish all events for the node `:id`. To unsubscribe simply close the socket.

* `/api/stream/:id/responses` - opens up one websocket that will publish all user responses for the node `:id`. To unsubscribe simply close the socket.

* `/api/stream/all` - is a single websocket that will allow the consumer to subscribe, and unsubscribe to multiple node's events and/or data points. It also supports channel filtering.

### `/api/stream/:id/data`

You can subscribe to a specific node's data feed using the following command:
Example Subscription:
```bash
TODO: POST /api/stream/:id/data UPGRADE
```

After you have subscribed the socket will receive a json payload whenever a data point is received in carbon.

Example Payload:
```json
{
  "parentNodeId": 1,
  "parentNodeUniqueId": "unq_1_1",
  "nodeTypeId": 1,
  "nodeId":2,
  "uniqueId": "unq_2_2",
  "channelName": "some_channel",
  "timestamp": "",
  "value": "some value"
}
```

### `/api/stream/:id/event`

You can subscribe to a specific node's event feed using the following command:
Example Subscription:
```bash
TODO: POST /api/stream/:id/event UPGRADE
```

After you have subscribed the socket will receive a json payload whenever a change occurs due to a rule in carbon.

Example Payload:
```json
{
  "nodeTypeId": 1,
  "nodeId": 1,
  "channelName": "some_channel",
  "timestamp": "",
  "value": "some_value",
  "ruleId": 1,
  "change": ""
}
```

### `/api/stream/:id/response`

You can subscribe to a specific node's user response feed using the following command:
Example Subscription:
```bash
TODO: POST /api/stream/:id/response UPGRADE
```

After you have subscribed the socket will receive a json payload whenever a change occurs due to a user feedback response in in carbon.

Example Payload:
```json
{
  "nodeId": 1,
  "ruleId": 1,
  "userId": 1,
  "timestamp": "",
  "updatedAt": "",
  "change": "ack"
}
```

### `/api/stream/all`

The `stream/all` is similar to the other endpoints except it allows the consumer to receive data, and events from multiple nodes through the same websocket.

After the initial handshake with the websocket, the consumer will need to instruct the server as to what it wants to receive. This is done via a `request` payload.

Example `request` payload:

```json
{
  "action":"subscribe:data",
  "arguments": {
    "nodeId": 1,
    "channelName": "some_channel"
  }
}
```

#### Available actions

* `subscribe:data` - will subscribe to a specific node's datapoints.
* `unsubscribe:data` - will unsubscribe a node from the socket feed.
* `subscribe:event` -  will subscribe to a node's events.
* `unsubscribe:event` - will unsubscribe from a node's events.
* `subscribe:response` -  will subscribe to a node's user responses.
* `unsubscribe:response` - will unsubscribe from a node's user responses.

#### Available Arguments

Arguments allow the consumer to specify filters for a particular subscription. They are passed in via the `arguments` object in the request.

For data subscriptions:

* `nodeId` - Required - Specify to filter the data stream based on node id.
* `channelName` - Optional - Specify to filter the data stream based on a channel.

For event subscriptions:

* `nodeId` - Required - Specify to filter the event stream based on node id.

Once the consumer is subscribed to a node the server will return an `response` object.

#### Response Payload

The response json the server returns will contain the action type the message is for and a few status indicators.

Example `response` payload:

```json
{
  "type":"acknowledge",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "statusMessage": "subscribed to event stream for node id 5",
  "payload": {}
}
```

#### Available payload types

* `acknowledge` - this is an acknowledge response to notify the consumer of the success status of their request.
* `data` - this is a payload with a datapoint from a node.
* `event` - this is a payload type with an event that resulted from a state change.
* `response` - this is a payload type with an event that resulted from a user response.

Example data payload:

```json
{
  "parentNodeId": 1,
  "parentNodeUniqueId": "unq_1_1",
  "nodeTypeId": 1,
  "nodeId":2,
  "uniqueId": "unq_2_2",
  "channelName": "some_channel",
  "timestamp": "",
  "value": "some value"
}
```

Example event payload:

```json
{
  "nodeTypeId": 1,
  "nodeId": 1,
  "channelName": "some_channel",
  "timestamp": "",
  "value": "some_value",
  "ruleId": 1,
  "change": ""
}
```

Example response payload:


```json
{
  "nodeId": 1,
  "ruleId": 1,
  "userId": 1,
  "timestamp": "",
  "updatedAt": "",
  "change": "acknowledge"
}
```
